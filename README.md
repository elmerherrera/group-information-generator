# group-information-generator

## Describing everything
We were provided with some starter code to get started. I implemented node.js so that it can take my information and apply it to a line that gives options on what to do. When starting it up I am given options where Manager, Engineer, Intern, And ending are given. Going through and adding each title you are presented with questions asking various thing to include. Name, Email, Id, Role, Office number, Github, and School. Once you have finished adding a Manager, Engineer, and Intern a team.html is created and added to your output folder
